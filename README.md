## 🏢 SOC Fundamentals  

### ❓ What is a SOC and why do organizations need it?  
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized unit that **monitors, detects, analyzes, and responds** to cybersecurity incidents.  
Organizations need a SOC to:  
- Provide **24/7 monitoring** of systems and networks.  
- Detect **anomalies, intrusions, and threats** in real-time.  
- Support **incident response** and reduce business impact.  
- Ensure compliance with **regulatory frameworks** (ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.).

### ❓ Explain SOC roles & tiers (L1, L2, L3, Threat Hunter, IR).  

- **Tier 1 (SOC Analyst / Alert Triage):**  
  - Monitors SIEM alerts.  
  - Performs **initial triage**.  
  - Escalates real incidents to Tier 2.  

- **Tier 2 (Incident Responder):**  
  - Performs **deep analysis** of alerts.  
  - Investigates **log correlations, network traffic, malware samples**.  
  - Coordinates containment & remediation.  

- **Tier 3 (Threat Hunter / SME):**  
  - Hunts for **unknown/advanced threats** using hypothesis-driven searches.  
  - Creates **detection rules & playbooks**.  
  - Supports Tier 1 & 2.  

- **Incident Response Team (IR):**  
  - Specialized responders handling **containment, eradication, recovery**.  
  - Works closely with legal, PR, and management.  

### ❓ What is the difference between detection and prevention?  

- **Detection:**  
  - Identifying suspicious or malicious activity **after it occurs**.  
  - Example: SIEM alert for failed login attempts.  

- **Prevention:**  
  - Blocking malicious activity **before it causes harm**.  
  - Example: Firewall blocking malicious IP addresses.  

👉 A mature SOC uses **both detection and prevention** to strengthen defense.  

### ❓ What types of data/logs does a SOC collect?  
- **Network logs:** Firewall, IDS/IPS, proxies, routers.  
- **Endpoint logs:** Antivirus, EDR, Windows Event IDs, Sysmon.  
- **Authentication logs:** Active Directory, LDAP, IAM systems.  
- **Application logs:** Web servers, databases.  
- **Cloud logs:** AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, GCP Logs.  

### ❓ What is the Kill Chain model?  
The **Cyber Kill Chain** by `Lockheed Martin` describes attacker steps:  
1. Reconnaissance  
2. Weaponization  
3. Delivery  
4. Exploitation  
5. Installation  
6. Command & Control  
7. Actions on Objectives
 
👉 SOC teams map detections and defenses to each phase.  

### ❓ What is the MITRE ATT&CK framework and why is it important for SOC?  
- **MITRE ATT&CK** is a knowledge base of **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used by adversaries.  
- Helps SOC teams to:  
  - Map alerts to known attacker behaviors.  
  - Develop detection use cases.  
  - Guide threat hunting.  
  - Identify coverage gaps.


### ❓ What are common SOC challenges?  
- **Alert fatigue:** Too many false positives.  
- **Tool overload:** Managing multiple tools without integration.  
- **Skill gap:** Shortage of trained SOC analysts.  
- **Evolving threats:** Adapting to zero-days and new attack techniques.  
- **Visibility gaps:** Missing logs or blind spots in monitoring.
